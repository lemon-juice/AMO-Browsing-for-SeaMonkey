AMO Browsing for SeaMonkey
==========================

When this add-on has been installed it will add a "View Version History" link
to the download page of Firefox or Thunderbird add-ons. This link takes you to
a new page, which lists the most recent versions of an add-on, and offers install,
convert, and/or download buttons when appropriate.

Usually, you will want to use the most recent version of an extension that has
SeaMonkey support, or (if there is none) the most recent version that does not
require WebExtensions.

Add-ons that use WebExtensions are not compatible with SeaMonkey, but you
might be able to find older, non-WebExtensions versions that will work.
