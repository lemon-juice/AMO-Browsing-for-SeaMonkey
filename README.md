AMO Browsing for SeaMonkey
==========================

When this add-on has been installed it will add some SeaMonkey
specific information to the AMO (addons.mozilla.org) download page of Firefox or
Thunderbird add-ons. After a single click to check whether a SeaMonkey
specific add-on exists, it will show a hyperlink leading to the SeaMonkey
[Add-On Converter](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=2834855),
which will do some modifications with the
selected add-on so that it should run with SeaMonkey.
Please be aware that not all add-ons will work
with SeaMonkey after the conversion; you will find a
link to a compatibility list on the converter page.

Add-ons that use WebExtensions are not compatible with SeaMonkey, but you
might be able to find older, non-WebExtensions versions that will work.
